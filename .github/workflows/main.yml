# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # setup node.js environment
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      # Deploy
      - name: SFTP uploader
        uses: wangyucode/sftp-upload-action@v1
        with:
          host: 'wycode.cn'
          port: 22 # optional, default is 22 
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }} # optional, default is root
